== Description ==

Meow Gallery allows you to easily enhance the native Wordpress galery, making it responsive, retina, and using modern layouts.

**Demo**
Because a demo is worth a thousand word, you can see a live example [HERE](http://haikyo.org/western-village/).
Note: This website is also using the Meow Lightbox plugin.

**Layouts Available**
- Masonry
- Justified ( Flickr-like )
- Instagram ( Square images )
- And many more to come in futur updates !

**Features**
- We use the native wordpress gallery. Which means this plugin works out of the box.
- Responsive.
- Light and fast, again, since we use the gallery system built in Wordpress, our code is very light.

**Compatibility**
We recommend you to use our other plugin **Meow Lightbox**, it's working seamlessly with the Meow Gallery plugin.
